title: Importing Gene Sets
---

On this page, the user can import gene sets to use in later steps of the toolkit's pipeline. There are three ways to import gene sets, and they are described below.

## Import Gene Sets from a GMT File

The first option is to upload a GMT file detailing the user's gene set. For this option, the user must provide a collection name and a GMT file in the text and file inputs respectively. If the collection they have named already exists, the gene set from the GMT file will be added to that collection. Otherwise, a new collection with the given name will be created. Then the user must click "Upload."

## Select from a Database

SCTK also has a database of gene sets that the user can choose from. For this option, the user must simply select the gene sets they would like to upload and click "Upload." A brief description of each gene set is provided in the checklist.

## Paste in Gene Sets

The user also has the option to paste their gene set into a text box. In order to do so, the user must paste their gene set into the provided text box and then provide a collection name to create a new collection. If there are already gene sets imported, the user can choose an existing collection to add their pasted gene set into. Then the user must click "Upload."
