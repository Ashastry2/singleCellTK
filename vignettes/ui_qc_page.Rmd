title: Using the UI to generate QC metrics
---

This section of the toolkit will allow users to generate quality control (QC) metrics for the single-cell data that they have imported.  Below is a guide on how to navigate the page.

## Select which algorithms to run

The user must check off which algorithms they would like to run in order to see their parameters. After filling out the parameters for each checked algorithm, the user must click "Run" to see the results.  There are "Help" menus that explain the parameters for each algorithm, and they are accesible once the user checks off a certain algorithm.

## Plot the results
Once the QC algorithms have finished running, plots for each algorithm's results will appear to the right of the QC algorithms' panel that, by default, will use UMAP as its reducedDimName parameter. The user can use the dropdown menu above the plots to change which reducedDimName to use when plotting, and the plots will automatically update to reflect that change. Each algorithm's plots will appear under their own tab, and each sample will get its own sub-tab.
