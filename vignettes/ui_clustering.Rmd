## Introduction

This section describes the usage of the user interface (UI) for singleCellTK (SCTK) clustering workflow. The underneath process is wrapped by R function for clustering, including `runScranSNN()`, `runKMeans()` and `seuratFindClusters()`. For the help of R console workflow, also refer to [the help page for R console](clustering.html).  

## UI Layout

### Entry of The Panel

From anywhere of the UI, the panel for marker finding can be accessed from the top navigation panel at the circled tab shown below.  

![Entry](clst_ui_entry.png)\

The UI is includes two panels. The top one is for setting the parameters and run the clustering, while the bottom one is for visualizing the results. 

### Run Clustering

#### Choose An Algorithm

User will choose an algorithm to run the clustering at the very first step. The slide-down option list is constructed in a grouped style. Each group lists all the algorithm that a dependency (shown with grey text) supports. By selecting an algorithm the belongs to different groups, the parameter settings will change.

#### Parameter Settings

##### Scran SNN

![scran](clst_ui_scran.png)\

When the selected algorithm belongs to "Scran SNN" group, the parameter settings will look like the figure above.  

- Data matrix selection - selection input **"Select Input Matrix"**. 
- Resolution setting - numeric input **"K value"**.
- Algorithm detail setting - selection input **"Edge Weight Type"**.
- Component number setting (Only when the chosen data matrix is an "assay") - numeric input **"Number of Components"**.

##### K-Means

![kmeans](clst_ui_kmeans.png)\

When the selected algorithm belongs to "K-Means" group, the parameter settings will look like the figure above.  

- Data matrix selection - selection input **"Select a ReducedDim"**.
- Cluster number determining - numeric input **"Number of Centers (Clusters)"**.
- Iteration limit setting - numeric input **"Max Number of Iterations"**.
- Algorithm detail setting - numeric input **"Number of Random Sets"**.

##### Seurat

![seurat](clst_ui_seurat.png)\

When the selected algorithm belongs to "Seurat" group, the parameter settings will look like the figure above.  

- Data matrix selection - selection input **"Select a ReducedDim"**.
- Component number setting - numeric input **"How Many Dimensions to Use"**.
- Algorithm detail setting - checkbox input **"Group Singletons"**.
- Resolution setting - numeric input **"Resolution"**.

### Visualization

<img src="clst_ui_vis.png" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.2)"></img>

The visualization is implemented with a plotting of a chosen dimension reduction, colored with a chosen cluster assignment.  

- Cluster annotation selection. radio button selection **"Select from Current Results"** and **"Select from All Present Annotation"**. And a selection input follows.
- Dimension Reduction selection - selection input **"Use Reduction"**.
