title: "Importing scRNA-seq data into Single Cell ToolKit"
---

Single Cell ToolKit enables importing data from the following pre-processing tools-

- [CellRanger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger)
- [Optimus](https://data.humancellatlas.org/pipelines/optimus-workflow)
- [DropEst](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/dropEst)
- [BUStools](https://github.com/BUStools/bustools)
- [Seqc](https://github.com/ambrosejcarr/seqc)
- [STARSolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/docs/STARsolo.md)

The following table describes how SingleCellTK expects the inputs to be structured and passed for each
import function. In all cases, SingleCellTK retains the standard output directory structure for upstream tools. 
All the import functions return the imported counts matrix as a SingleCellExperiment object assay, 
with associated information in respective colData, rowData, reducedDims, and metadata fields.
