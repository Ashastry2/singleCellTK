title: Using the UI to generate QC metrics

## Introduction

![entry](qc_ui_entry.png)\

Single Cell Toolkit (SCTK) allows users to generate quality control (QC) metrics for the single-cell data that they have imported. Users should enter the page through the way as shown in the screenshot above.  

Here SCTK provides generic QC metrics, as well as contamination estimation by [decontX](https://rdrr.io/bioc/celda/man/decontX.html), and doublet detection algorithms including [scDblFinder](https://rdrr.io/bioc/scDblFinder/), [cxds](https://rdrr.io/bioc/scds/man/cxds.html), [bcds](https://rdrr.io/bioc/scds/man/bcds.html), [cxds_bcds_hybrid](https://rdrr.io/bioc/scds/man/cxds_bcds_hybrid.html), [doubletFinder](https://rdrr.io/github/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/DoubletFinder/man/doubletFinder.html), and [scrublet](https://github.com/swolock/scrublet). Note that "scrublet" is Python based. Users should have it configured before trying to apply it. The configuration method would be introduced in the end.  

## Select which algorithms to run

Users must check which algorithms they would like to run. The parameters for the corresponding algorithms will pop out as users check it. Users may adjust the parameters as needed.



2. After filling out the parameters for each checked algorithm, users must click **"Run"** to start the QC procedure. There are "Help" menus that explain the parameters for each algorithm, and they are accesible once users check a certain algorithm.

## Plot the results
Once the QC algorithms have finished running, plots for each algorithm's results will appear to the right of the QC algorithms' panel that, by default, will use UMAP as its reducedDimName parameter. The user can use the dropdown menu above the plots to change which reducedDimName to use when plotting, and the plots will automatically update to reflect that change. Each algorithm's plots will appear under their own tab, and each sample will get its own sub-tab.
