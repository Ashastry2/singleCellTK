## General Prerequistes

1. **R (>=4.0)**. [Install R](#install-r-4-0-)

SingleCellTK is an R based package, allowing users to run analysis in system command-line, R console, and R Shiny user interface. To get your machine fully equipped with SCTK, you must have **R (>=4.0)** pre-installed.   

2. **singleCellTK** package. [See detail](#install-sctk)

With R successfully installed, users can now start to install SingleCellTK to your local. For quick start, BioConductor users can directly requiste our released version with the following command:  

```{R biocSCTK, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("singleCellTK")
```

3. **Python environment**. [Install Python](#install-python-dependencies)  

Additionally, SCTK wraps a number of useful toolkits, where a part of them are Python based. To enable this part of functionality, users need to get Python (3.x) and a set of Python packages built.  

For users who would like to perform console interactive analysis, we strongly suggest that you have [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed. 

## Step by Step Installation

### Install R (>=4.0)

Users can go to [**R Official Site**](https://www.r-project.org/) to choose the preferred installer.  

In the site, users will need to first **specify a CRAN mirror**. CRAN is a network of servers around the world that store approved R dependencies. Specifying a mirror that is the nearest to you helps minimize network load.  

![chooseMirror](ui_screenshots/installation/RChooseMirror.png)\

Linux, Windows and MacOS users will be able to find the corresponding installer at the top of the page after choosing a mirror.

### Install SCTK

#### Released version (BioConductor) 

Our latest stable release is available on BioConductor. BioConductor is a distribution platform for biology-related packages. The page for SCTK can be found [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/singleCellTK.html)

Run the following command in **R console** to install SCTK from BioConductor:

```{R biocSCTK2, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("singleCellTK")
```

#### Devel version (GitHub)

We occasionally push new developmental releases of our source code on GitHub.  

The simplest way to install the developing version is as followed:  

```{R installDevel, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("compbiomed/singleCellTK")
```

Meanwhile, the source code can be downloaded [Here](https://github.com/compbiomed/singleCellTK/releases)  

![chooseMirror](ui_screenshots/installation/sourceCodeAssets.png)\

To install from source code, you need to first **download the tarball file (ending with `.tar.gz`)**, which is a compressed file for the whole directory. Then **in R console**, run the following command:  

```{R sourceSCTK, eval=FALSE}
# REPLACE {PATH} with the path you place the downloaded tarball file
# REPLACE {VERSION} with the version number in the filename
install.packages("{PATH}/singleCellTK_{VERSION}.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```

### Install Python Dependencies

SCTK can be successfully loaded without a Python installation. While there are some parts of our analysis that support multiple methods, some options among them would require a live Python environment. For example, the quality control and batch correction sections.  

For experienced Python programmers, the minimum required Python packages are listed below:

```
scipy numpy astroid six scrublet scanpy bbknn scanorama
```

#### Non-Python users

If you have not had Python installed before, and do not have a plan to use Python. We have prepared a simple command to minimize the workload for you to clear the barrier. **After installing SCTK** in your R console:

```{R reticulateSetup, eval=FALSE}
library(singleCellTK)
sctkPythonInstallConda()
```

#### Work with Python

If you would like to start to work with Python or are already an experienced Python programmer, here we skip the approach to the Python installation. If you have a standalone Python installation, it is not necessary to run the command above because it is likely to create a redundant Miniconda copy in your machine. The dependencies needed are listed above in this section and you can install them with either `conda` or `pip`.  

## Troubleshooting Installation

### BioConductor Versioning

For the majority of users, the commands above will install the latest version of the singleCellTK without any errors.  

Rarely, you may encounter an error due to previously installed versions of some packages that are required for the singleCellTK. If you encounter an error during installation, use the commands below to check the version of Bioconductor that is installed:

```{R biocmV, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::version()
```

If the version number is not 3.6 or higher, you must upgrade Bioconductor to install the toolkit:

```{R biocmI, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install()
```

After you install Bioconductor 3.6 or higher, you should be able to install the toolkit. If you still encounter an error, ensure your Bioconductor packages are up to date by running the following command.

```{R biocmVld, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::valid()
```

If the command above does not return `TRUE`, run the following command to update your R packages:

```{R biocmI2, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install()
```

Then, try to install the toolkit again.  

### Python and Reticulate

SCTK adopts [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) to connect R with Python. If the specific functions in SCTK, which requires Python dependencies, do not properly start to run after you have installed the dependencies or restart the R session, please try to specify the correct Python executable/binary file in a **new R session**. (here "new" means no Python or reticulate related operations have been performed)

```{R reticulateFix, eval=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_python("{PATH to the correct Python exexutable/binary file}")
```

You can always use `reticulate::py_config()` to check what specific Python version you are using and what other versions are available. `py_config()` configures the R-to-Python connection at once, so you will have to restart the R session if you need to change the configuration with `use_python()` after you have the check done.  

If you still encounter an error, please [raise an Issue](https://github.com/compbiomed/singleCellTK/issues) at our GitHub repository and we'd be happy to help.  

## Develop singleCellTK
