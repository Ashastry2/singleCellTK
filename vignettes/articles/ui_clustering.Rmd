## Introduction

This section describes the usage of the user interface (UI) for singleCellTK (SCTK) clustering workflow. The underneath process is wrapped by R function for clustering, including `runScranSNN()`, `runKMeans()` and `seuratFindClusters()`. For the help of R console workflow, also refer to [the help page for R console](clustering.html).  

## UI Layout

### Entry of The Panel

From anywhere of the UI, the panel for clustering can be accessed from the top navigation panel at the circled tab shown below.  

![Entry](ui_screenshots/clustering/clst_ui_entry.png)\

The UI is includes two panels. The top one is for setting the parameters and run the clustering, while the bottom one is for visualizing the results. 

### Run Clustering

#### Choose An Algorithm

<img src="ui_screenshots/clustering/clst_ui_algo.png" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.2)"></img>

User will choose an algorithm to run the clustering at the very first step. The slide-down option list is constructed in a grouped style. Each group lists all the algorithm that a dependency (shown with grey text) supports. By selecting an algorithm that belongs to different groups, the parameter settings will change.

#### Parameter Settings

##### Scran SNN

![scran](ui_screenshots/clustering/clst_ui_scran.png)\

When the selected algorithm belongs to "Scran SNN" group, the parameter settings will look like the figure above. For the choices in the algorithm list, please refer to `igraph::cluster_walktrap()`, `igraph::cluster_louvain()`, `igraph::cluster_infomap()`, `igraph::cluster_fast_greedy()`, `igraph::cluster_label_prop()`, and `igraph::cluster_leading_eigen()`.  

- Data matrix selection - selection input **"Select Input Matrix"**. Scran SNN method allows various type of data matrix. Either A full-sized or subsetted expression matrix, technically called `assay` or `altExp`, respectively, or a dimension reduction, technically `reducedDim`, is allowed. 
- Resolution setting - numeric input **"K value"**. `K` is an integer scalar specifying the number of nearest neighbors to consider during graph construction. Considering more neighbors results in larger groups. (See parameter `k` of `scran::buildSNNGraph()`)
- Algorithm detail setting - selection input **"Edge Weight Type"**. User can specify the type of weighting scheme to use for shared neighbors. (See parameter `type` of `scran::buildSNNGraph()`)
- Component number setting (Only used when the chosen data matrix is an `assay` or `altExp`) - numeric input **"Number of Components"**. When an `assay` or `altExp` is chosen, the algorithm will perform a PCA on the matrix and obtain the top principal components (PCs) for downstream use. Thus users will specify the number of PCs here. 

##### K-Means

When the selected algorithm belongs to "K-Means" group, the parameter settings will look like the figure above.  

- Data matrix selection - selection input **"Select a ReducedDim"**. Here the data matrix allowed can only be a dimension reduction, technically called `reducedDim`. Should be obtained in advance from ["Feature Selection & Dimension Reduction" tab](#). 
- Cluster number determining - numeric input **"Number of Centers (Clusters)"**. User will decide the exact number of clusters here. In term of K-means algorithm, the number of cluster centroids. 
- Iteration limit setting - numeric input **"Max Number of Iterations"**. User will here decide the maximum number of iterations to run. 
- Algorithm detail setting - numeric input **"Number of Random Sets"**. Kmeans attempts multiple initial configurations and reports on the best one. Here users will set the number of initial configurations to use. 

##### Seurat

![seurat](ui_screenshots/clustering/clst_ui_seurat.png)\

When the selected algorithm belongs to "Seurat" group, the parameter settings will look like the figure above.  

- Data matrix selection - selection input **"Select a ReducedDim"**. Here the data matrix allowed can only be a dimension reduction, technically called `reducedDim`. Should be obtained in advance from ["Feature Selection & Dimension Reduction" tab](#). 
- Component number setting - numeric input **"How Many Dimensions to Use"**.
- Algorithm detail setting - checkbox input **"Group Singletons"**.
- Resolution setting - numeric input **"Resolution"**.

### Visualization

<img src="ui_screenshots/clustering/clst_ui_vis.png" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.2)"></img>

The visualization is implemented with a plotting of a chosen dimension reduction, colored with a chosen cluster assignment.  

- Cluster annotation selection. radio button selection **"Select from Current Results"** and **"Select from All Present Annotation"**. And a selection input follows. Only a successful run of clustering in the current SCTK session adds an option for the new result to "Select from Current Results", while all the cell annotation stored in background (i.e. `colData(sce)`) are accessible if "Select from All Present Annotation" is chosen. 
- Dimension Reduction selection - selection input **"Use Reduction"**. User have to choose a reduction here for plotting. If there is not yet any option, user can obtain one from ["Feature Selection & Dimension Reduction" tab](#).
