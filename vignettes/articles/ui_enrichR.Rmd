## Introduction
***EnrichR*** ([Kuleshov MV, Jones MR, Rouillard AD, et al. Enrichr: a comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis web server 2016 update. Nucleic Acids Res. 2016;44(W1):W90-W97.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fnar%2Fgkw377) and [Chen, E.Y., Tan, C.M., Kou, Y. et al. Enrichr: interactive and collaborative HTML5 gene list enrichment analysis tool. BMC Bioinformatics 14, 128 (2013).](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-128)) is a ***GSE*** (Gene Set Enrichment) method that infers biological knowledge by performing enrichment of input gene sets with curated biologically relevant prior databases that represent biological functions or functional pathways. The ***singleCellTK*** offers an easy to use interface to the ***EnrichR*** method and only requires the selection of ***input genes*** and the ***databases*** against which the genes should be tested.

## General Worflow
The figure below describes the workflow of using ***EnrichR*** through ***singleCellTK*** user interface:

## Workflow Guide
An overall workflow guide on how to use ***EnrichR*** sub-tab is described below. ***This workflow guide assumes that the *SingleCell Data* has already been uploaded through the *Import Single Cell Data*** sub-tab. <br>

![](ui_screenshots/pathway_analysis/enrichR_1.png)

1. Select ***Cell Annotation & Pathway Analysis*** tab from the top menu. <br>
2. Select ***EnrichR*** option from the drop-down menu. <br>

3. Select if you want to upload a gene symbol file using the option ***Upload file*** or choose the ***Select Gene(s)*** option if you want to select genes from the already uploaded data. <br>

4. If ***Select Gene(s)*** option is selected, you can select the genes from the available data here. Alternatively, you can upload a gene file using the options specified in **(9)** and **(10)**. <br>

5. Select ***databases*** to test the input genes against. Selecting ***ALL*** will test against all available ***databases*** and may take long time to compute. <br>

6. Press ***Run*** to start computation of enrichment scores. <br>

7. Once ***EnrichR*** computation is complete, results can be saved to local drive by pressing the ***Download Results*** button. <br>

8. Results are displayed in the table for genes that are significant (adjusted p value < 0.05). <br>

9. If ***Upload file*** option is selected in **(3)**, additional options are displayed to upload the ***gene symbols*** file. The file path can be selected here. <br>

10. Once filed is selected in **(9)**, options to select the parameters of the input file are displayed so the input file is correctly parsed. <br>
